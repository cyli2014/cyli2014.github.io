### STI-4A_EI316

This project is for Science and Technology Innovation (Part 4-A) in Shanghai Jiao Tong University. The project requires a master-slave communication system including three subsystems such as water-heating system, ultrasonic system and motor system, which are monitored by MSP430 MCU. We are supposed to use RS-422 serial bus to establish connection between three subsystems and the local controller. Thus we need to build a GUI on local PC to control the subsystems conveniently. We use C# to build the GUI and finally achieve controling the subsystems through bus and WiFi simultaneously. Click [here][EI316] to see corresponding codes.

### DIP_EE346

This repository contains four separate projects for Digital Image Processing in Shanghai Jiao Tong University. 

* Project 1: Discrete Fourier Transform & Discrete Cosine Transform.

* Project 2: Encoding & Decoding of JPEG.

* Project 3: Histogram Equalizing and Piecewise Linear Transformation.

* Project 4: An Improved Canny Edge Dectection Alogorithm. Accomplished with Cai Yang and Qian Yuguang.

Project repository is stored [here][EE346].

### OS_EE328

This repository is for Operating System class in Shanghai Jiao Tong University, including 9 projects.

* Project 1: Snake-Like Increment Tables.

* Project 2: Bank Accounts.

* Project 3: Slary System.

* Project 4: I/O and Simple Network Programming.

* Project 5: Simple GUI Programming.

* Project 7: Simple Shell.

* Project 8: Matrix Multiplication.

* Project 9: Banker's Algorithm.

* Project 10: Design a File System.

[The repository][EE328] includes detailed reports on each project and you can read them to understand better.

### A Sleepy Consensus Simulator

I participated in a summer program in Cornell University where I took Blockchain lectures by Prof. Elaine Shi. She arranged a project that required us to realize a sleepy consensus simulator discribed in her papers. In this project I helped to write introduction of Stubborn Adversary Attack and Selfish Eclipse Attack in project whitepaper. 

### 2048 Assignment

Apart from Blockchain lectures I also participated in Programming Semantics and Programming Methedology by Prof. David Gries. Prof. Gries introduced loop invariant to help us build correct loops in a strict way. By the end of the class Prof. Gries arranged an assignment that required us to realize a `moveLeft()` method in the game 2048. A detailed report is also attached in [the prject repository][2048]. 

### Home Page

This home page is modified from a Jekyll theme [Centrarium][centrarium] by Ben Centra. It took me lots of time to customize it. If you are interested in this theme you can go both [Centrarium][centrarium-github] and [here][homepage] to fork it and turn it into your own home page.
